Stimulus Display Settings
=========================

The *Stimulus Display* settings control the presentation of stimuli for your experiment. In general, Habit does not process 
your stimuli in any way, except to resize them at your request (see below). Within this settings panel there are three 
sections:

   :align: center
   :height: 600px

Stimuli Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Stimuli Layout* section lets you specify whether your experiment will present a single visual stimuli or dual stimuli. You can 
also present sound stimuli simultaneous with your visual stimuli - to do so, check the "Use Independent Sound Stimuli" box. If you
choose this option, the configuration dialog for each stimulus will let you specify an audio file (the sound track from a movie file 
can be used).

Stimulus Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Stimulus Size* section tells Habit whether to resize your visual stimuli when presenting them, and if so, how to resize them. 
When a stimulus does not cover the entire presentation screen, the borders are filled in with the background color.

You can have stimuli presented at their native size by selecting the *Use Original Stimulus Size* radio button. Habit will center your stimuli on their
respective monitor screens without resizing them. When presenting stimuli at their original size, Habit makes no attempt to fit
stimuli on their chosen screen, and no warnings are issued when stimuli are too large for their screens. 

You can have your stimuli presented at full screen by selecting the *Display Full Screen* radio button. Selecting this option enables
a checkbox to require that the original aspect ratio of the stimulus be maintained.

Background Color
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Background Color* section specifies a color to be used to fill in the edges of a screen when a stimulus does not fill the 
entire screen, or when *Background color only* is checked in a stimulus configuration.
